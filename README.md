### Context

This project was carried out as part of the Web Project course at the Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in Finland.

### Authors

* Yadullah Abdul Sattar
* Agrin Sadon
* Mohammed Sadik Aziz
* Theo Mirabile (team leader)

### Description

The purpose of this project is to develop an online platform to publish appartment rent offers for students in Finland (for now, could be expanded to wider area later). It would help students that didn't got an apartment from regular student apartment providers to get in touch with private people that rent one.

### Target Users

As said before, this platform would mainly apply to apartment owners willing to rent it to students, and students themselves looking for an apartment.

### Other stakeholders

* There would also be a **moderation team** on the platform that ensures offers are fair and not scams. They would have the ability to hide offers that aren't fair.

* A **development team** would also be there to fix problems that could be happening using the platform

* A **customer service** that helps the users to use the platform

* **The users would be warned that the platform doesn't take legal responsability in any dispute.**

### Main functionality

* Search apartments by city, surface, rooms count, included services (water, power, internet, sauna), location (close to public transports) rent price, etc.

* Show an apartment offer, with a picture gallery, description, contact information, included services list

* Contact an apartment owner (by mail or phone, up to the landlord)

* Create a user account (tenant or landlord)
